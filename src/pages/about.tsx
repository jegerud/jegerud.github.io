          My name is Kristian Jegerud, and I am {getYearSince()} years old. I am
          originally from Skotterud in Eidskog, but currently lives in Trondheim
          for studies. Free time is used for CrossFit, the outdoors and playing
          the accordion.

            I have completed a 3-year bachelor's study in computer science at
            NTNU Gj√∏vik, giving me a solid basis within web development,
            mathematics and programming. I'm currently studying Industrial
            Cybernetics at NTNU, a 2 year master program that gives a solid
            basis with theoretical and practical knowledge in observing and
            management of dynamic systems. I have chosen to spread the master
            program over 3 years, making space for me to dive deeper into
            subject areas I am interested in.
